[*Predict your ATAR with scaling*](ordinarywizard.github.io/atar-calc)

This is a project I started to try and fill in a void I found in most ATAR Calculators. I found that most just asked for your final mark, so you had to go through and find your averages on Connect, SEQTA, calculate them etc. and then plug them in, which I thought was a huge waste of time. Instead this ATAR Calculator lets you punch in your individual test scores for each subject as they occur, which makes tracking your ATAR a lot easier, as it saves locally as well. It also has some functionality in terms of scaling your subjects. I used last years data to do it, and believe it to be pretty good. I based it off [this](https://www.tisc.edu.au/static-fixed/statistics/misc/average-marks-scaling.pdf).
Only some subjects support scaling right now (until I get more data):
- Physics
- English
- Methods
The whole website was based off a [spreadsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OrdinaryWizard/atar-calc/refs/heads/main/Grade%20Calculator%20copy.xlsx) I made earlier this year:
However I thought it to be unintuitive so I made this website.

You can use it by heading over to the [website](ordinarywizard.github.io/atar-calc) or cloning this repo and launching `index.html`.
